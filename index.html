		<div class="content-block">

		<p>This course is about Web Development.  This means you should conduct yourself as Web Developers!</p>
		<p>What does this mean? It means you should understand the following:</p>

		
			<dl>
				<dt>FTP</dt>
				<dd>If you don't understand FTP (File Transfer Protocol) right now, that's ok. After week 2 - don't ask me. This is a <strong>required</strong> skill</dd>
				
				<dt>File/Folder Names</dt>
				<dd>While it is technically possible, my recommendation is that you do NOT use capital letters, and I <strong>require</strong> that you do NOT use spaces in your file or folder names. Special Characters (those characters over the numbers on your keyboard) just won't work.</dd>
				
				<dt>Web Space</dt>
				<dd>The student web space is: <strong>students.thenet.ca/(student_name)</strong><br>
					Notice that there is <strong>no www</strong> at the front</dd>
					
				<dt>Upkeep</dt>
				<dd>Each week, you should have your course web space (we'll set up the course web site later) up to date with assignments, exercises, etc.</dd>
				
				<dt>Navigation</dt>
				<dd>Please try to make things as easy to find as possible</dd>
